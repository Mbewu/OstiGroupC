\chapter{Introduction}


\subsection*{by Jackie Ang}

Cancer is a major cause of death worldwide and is defined as unregulated
cell growth within a structure known as a tumour. Tumour growth can
be classified into a few distinct stages, which are hyperplasia, dysplasia,
in situ carcinoma and finally invasive cancer. As tumours are made
up of rapidly dividing cells, they require high amounts of oxygen
and glucose for survival and cell division. This rapidly overwhelms
the ability of normal blood vessels to provide these nutrients and
leads to angiogenesis within the tumours as well as the death of both
normal cells as well as cells in the interior of the tumour. Also,
as a consequence of hypoxia within the tumour, cells switch to using
anaerobic respiration and release lactic acid into the extracellular
environment. This causes a decrease in the pH in the environment within
and around the tumour and also leads to necrosis. 

Cellular automata has a long history of usage to model the growth
and development of tumours. In this investigation by A.A. Patel et
al, a hybrid cellular automaton was used to model an early stage of
tumour growth. The cellular automaton assumes tumour avascularity
and a random distribution of blood vessels in a tissue, which is true
for pre-angiogenic tumours. The model includes variables for glucose
and lactic acid concentration. It however, does not include a variable
for oxygen concentration as the author is focusing on the effects
of acidification of the microenvironment rather than hypoxia. It was
shown{[}1{]} that anaerobic respiration in tumour cells persists even
in high levels of oxygen and tumour cell viability is independent
of oxygen levels{[}2{]}. 


\chapter{Methods }


\subsection*{by Jackie Ang et al.}


\section{Setup of Cellular Automaton }

A two-dimensional cellular automaton was set up to model this tumour
growth. This was made up of a $N$ by $N$ array of elements with
a value corresponding to the state of each point. This state describes
the occupation status of each point, with values corresponding to
dividing normal cell, quiescent normal cell, dividing tumour cell,
quiescent tumour cell, blood vessel and unoccupied element. Two other
$N$ by $N$ arrays of elements with positional conservation to the
first array were also created to represent the glucose and lactic
acid concentrations of each individual automaton element. This differs
from the authors in that they created a matrix of state-vectors each
containing four components which correspond to the same variables,
but leads to the similar results. 

The author also mentioned one of the four above components as ghost
values used only on elements occupied by vessels to enforce gradient
boundary conditions at the four walls of the vessels. However, this
has been covered In our program by fixing the glucose and lactic acid
concentrations in elements occupied by vessels and not allowing them
to change during the process of running the cellular automaton. 

The cellular automaton was populated with a user defined microvessel
density $\phi_{v}$ where 
\[
\phi_{v}=\frac{N_{v}}{N^{2}}
\]
 where $N_{v}$ is the number of vessel elements inside the automaton. 

The program situates the vessel elements randomly, subject to the
condition that any given tumour cell or normal cell element can only
border zero or one vessel element. This is because if a cell element
borders two or more vessels, the value of the glucose and lactic concentrations
would be too strongly affected by the multiple boundary conditions
imposed by the vessels. 

All other elements within the cellular automaton were then populated
with dividing normal cells. Following this, a disc shaped group of
dividing tumour cells with a user defined diameter is introduced in
the centre of the automaton grid, replacing any normal cells or vessels
previously there. 

The other two $N$ by $N$ arrays are then populated with starting
values for glucose and lactic acid concentrations. For glucose concentrations,
a glucose profile is generated based on the diffusion equations and
the position of the vessels before the insertion of any non-vessel
cells. The glucose concentration at vessels however, is kept constant
at $G_{s}=5.0mM$. The lactic acid concentration is initialised at
all elements at $H_{s}=3.98\cdot10^{-5}mM$. This lactic acid concentration
corresponds to a pH of 7.4 in the extracellular environment. Within
the simulation, assumptions are made that lactic acid is the sole
acid responsible for pH changes in the model, none of the lactic acid
is neutralised and the pKa of lactic acid is constant. 


\section{Rules of Cellular Automaton}

There are several rules for this cellular automaton as described below 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Elements occupied by microvessels do not change in status, glucose
and lactic acid concentrations in the entire simulation. 
\item Normal cells and tumour cells cannot evolve into other forms of cells.
They can only change status from dividing to quiescent or vice versa.
They may also die and this results in a vacant element. 
\item If the occupancy of an automaton element is with a normal cell or
tumour cell, after each updating of glucose and lactic acid concentrations
of elements, if the local glucose concentration is below $G_{N}^{D}$
or $G_{T}^{D}$, which were both defined to be 2.5mM, the cell dies
and the occupancy becomes vacant. 
\item If there is enough glucose, the local lactic acid concentration of
the individual elements is then checked. For normal cells, if the
local lactic acid concentration exceeds $H_{N}^{D}$, defined as $1.58\cdot10^{-4}mM$
(pH 6.8), it dies. Otherwise if the concentration of lactic acid is
between $H_{N}^{Q}$, defined as $7.94X10-5mM$ (pH 7.1) and HDN,
the cell survives but becomes quiescent. For tumour cells, if the
local lactic acid concentration is above $H_{D}^{T}$, defined as
$1\cdot10^{-3}mM$ (pH 6.0), it dies. Otherwise if the concentration
of lactic acid is between $H_{T}^{Q}$, defined as $3.98\cdot10^{-4}$
(pH 6.4) and $H_{T}^{D}$, it survives but becomes quiescent. 
\item If the cell survives and is still actively dividing, it will be allowed
to reproduce. This can only occur if there is a vacant element adjacent
to the cell and can only occur once per cell even if there is more
than one vacant element adjacent to the cell. If there is more than
one vacant neighbour, the neighbouring element with the highest glucose
concentration will receive the daughter cell. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Running the Simulation }

While there is a large disparity in the timescales of cell division($10^{2}$
hours) and diffusion of glucose and lactic acid($10^{-2}$ hours)
between cells, the author has attempted to reconcile this difference
by stating that the cellular distributions of nutrients and by products
do not change after reaching a steady state quickly and changes in
cell status can be treated as perturbations on the chemical distributions.
He has also addressed the problem of all cells responding simultaneously
to changes in chemical distributions by advancing the automaton in
a series of sub-generations. A generation is defined as the time taken
for all the elements within the automaton to be updated. For the purpose
of the simulations, a generation consists of 10 sub-generations. 

Within each sub generation, a random subset (a tenth) of non-vessel
automaton elements are selected for updating. The update follows the
following order: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The glucose and lactic acid concentrations within the element are
updated according to the solution of the equilibrium boundary value
problems. 
\item The resultant concentrations are checked against threshold values
to determine if the status of elements containing normal or tumour
cells changes. 
\item Normal and Tumour cells are checked for potential of cell division
and cell division occurs if applicable. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{Glucose Inversion Problem}

\framebox{\begin{minipage}[t]{1\columnwidth}%
EDIT, EDIT, EDIT! pH should probably be added in the gluc section.
Adapt variable names to code, etc.%
\end{minipage}}

The problem is to obtain a spatial solution of a steady state diffusion
equation
\begin{equation}
D_{G}\nabla^{2}G\left(\mathbf{r}\right)-k\left(\mathbf{r}\right)G\left(\mathbf{r}\right)=0\label{eq:diffusion_eqn}
\end{equation}
for $G$. Here, $D_{G}$ is a scalar and $G$, $K$ are an $N\times N$
matrices. We want to solve this equation for the glucose concentration
$G\left(\mathbf{r}\right)$, i.e. on an $N\times N$ domain, with
periodic boundary conditions. 

I don't know about the level of rigor but maybe define $G$ in $V^{2}$
and in an orthonormal basis $\left\{ \mathbf{e}_{k}\right\} $ 
\[
G=G_{i,j}\mathbf{e}_{i}\otimes\mathbf{e}_{j}
\]
so you can properly talk about indices. The periodic boundary condtions
for the first index are
\begin{eqnarray*}
G_{0j} & \longrightarrow & G_{Nj}\\
G_{N+1,\, j} & \longrightarrow & G_{1,\, j}
\end{eqnarray*}
and the same for index. The cell distribution is expressed through
the matrix $k\left(\mathbf{r}\right)$ in terms of scalar values as
\begin{equation}
k\left(\mathbf{r}\right)=\begin{cases}
k_{N} & \forall\mathbf{r}=\text{Normal Cells}\qquad1\cdot10^{-6}/s<k_{N}<5\cdot10^{-4}/s\\
k_{T} & \forall\mathbf{r}=\text{Tumor Cells}\qquad1\cdot10^{-5}/s<k_{T}<1\cdot10^{-3}/s\\
0 & \forall\mathbf{r}=\text{Vacant Cells}\qquad\text{no vacant cells at simulation startup}\\
0 & \forall\mathbf{r}=\text{Vessel Cells}
\end{cases}\label{eq:k_mat}
\end{equation}
The discretisation of \eqref{eq:diffusion_eqn} in terms of finite
differences can be written as
\begin{equation}
\frac{G_{i+1,j}+G_{i-1,j}+G_{i,j+1}+G_{i,j-1}-4G_{i,j}}{\Delta^{2}}-\frac{k_{i,j}G_{i,j}}{D_{G}}=0\label{eq:eqn_8}
\end{equation}
where $D_{G}=9.1\cdot10^{-5}cm^{2}/s$ where $\Delta^{2}\approx\left(20\mu\right)^{2}$
is a rough approximation for cell size, i.e. an automaton element.
At this point, we have set up the system fully except for the vessel
boundary conditions. 


\section{Vessel Boundary Conditions}

The reason why \ref{eq:eqn_8} unfortunately cannot be written as
a linear system $DG=K.*G$%
\footnote{meaning $\left(DG\right)_{ij}=D_{im}G_{mj}$ and $(K.*G)_{ij}=K_{ij}G_{ij}$,
not sure how to express that mathematically, I am just using Matlab
element wise notation ;-) %
} is the vessel boundary conditions. If a vessel is placed at $i,\, j$
(corresponding to $k_{ij}=0$ since no vacant at startup, see \ref{eq:k_mat})
then $G_{ij}$ cannot be accessed and therefore \ref{eq:eqn_8} must
be modified.

If, for instance, a cell $\left(i,j\right)$ has a vessel to its right
($i,j-1$), the latter cannot be accessed. 
\begin{equation}
\frac{G_{i+1,j}+G_{i-1,j}+G_{i,j+1}-4G_{i,j}}{\Delta^{2}}-\left(3+\frac{\Delta^{2}k_{i,j}+q_{G}\Delta}{D_{G}}\right)G_{i,j}=-\frac{q_{G}\Delta}{D_{G}}G_{S}\label{eq:eqn_13}
\end{equation}
where $G_{S}$ is the serum glucose value $G_{S}\approx5.0mM$ and
the permeability of the vessel wall is $q_{G}\approx3.0\cdot10^{-5}cm/s$. 


\section{Numerical Approach}

We are interested in obtaining the elements of the glucose concentration
matrix 
\[
G\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times N}
\]
from the values of the matrix 
\begin{equation}
k\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times N}\label{eq:k_mat_general}
\end{equation}
 specified in \ref{eq:k_mat}. 

In order to be able to manipulate elements $G_{ij}$ individually,
we construct an $N^{2}\times N^{2}$ matrix $D$ and reformulate the
$N\times N$ matrix $G$ into a column vector $\mathbf{g}$ with $N^{2}$
elements. More precisely, if 
\[
G^{T}=\left(\mathbf{G}_{1}\quad\mathbf{G}_{2}\quad\cdots\quad\mathbf{G}_{N}\right)\qquad G^{T}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times N}
\]
we choose
\[
\mathbf{g}=\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf{G}_{1}\\
\mathbf{G}_{2}\\
\vdots\\
\mathbf{G}_{N}
\end{pmatrix}\qquad\mathbf{g}\in\mathbb{R}^{N^{2}}
\]
and $D\in\mathbb{R}^{N^{2}\times N^{2}}$, $\mathbf{b}\in\mathbb{R}^{N^{2}}$,
$\mathbf{k}\in\mathbb{R}^{N^{2}}$ where the latter two are yet to
be constructed. As a result, we can formulate a linear matrix inversion
problem 
\begin{equation}
D\mathbf{g}=\mathbf{b}\qquad\mathbf{g}=D^{-1}\mathbf{b}\label{eq:inversion_problem}
\end{equation}
which will be a solution to \ref{eq:eqn_8} coupled to \ref{eq:eqn_13}.
In components, the problem reads
\[
\underbrace{\begin{pmatrix}\\
\\
\\
\\
 & D_{ij}\\
\\
\\
\end{pmatrix}}_{N^{2}\times N^{2}}\begin{pmatrix}G_{11}\\
\vdots\\
G_{1N}\\
G_{21}\\
\vdots\\
G_{NN}
\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}\mathbf{G}_{1}\\
\mathbf{G}_{2}\\
\\
\vdots\\
\\
\mathbf{G}_{N}
\end{pmatrix}
\]
A map 1-to-1 map between $G\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times N}$ and $\mathbf{g}\in\mathbb{R}^{N^{2}}$
can be worked out. If $i,\, j$ are the indices of $G$ and $c$ is
the element number of $\mathbf{g}$, we get routines

\begin{eqnarray}
{\tt function\,\, C} & {\tt =} & {\tt CfromIJ(I,\, J,\, N)}\label{eq:map_CfromIJ}\\
{\tt function[I,\, J]} & {\tt =} & {\tt IJfromC(C,\, N)}\label{eq:map_IJfromC}
\end{eqnarray}
\textbf{In simple terms}, the goal is in obtaining the glucose matrix
$G\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times N}$ by first mapping the problem to an $N^{2}\times N^{2}$
problem using the map \ref{eq:map_CfromIJ}, inverting it according
to \ref{eq:inversion_problem} and using the inverse \ref{eq:map_IJfromC}
to obtain values for $G$. 


\section{Inversion Algorithm}

\framebox{\begin{minipage}[t]{1\columnwidth}%
\begin{enumerate}
\item Identify the indices $i^{*},\, j^{*}$ in $k_{ij}$ (see eq. \ref{eq:k_mat_general})
on which a vessel is placed. Use the map \ref{eq:map_CfromIJ} to
obtain $c^{*}$ and set
\[
D_{c^{*}k}=\delta_{c^{*}k}\quad\Leftrightarrow\quad G_{i^{*}j^{*}}=1
\]
i.e. update one row in D. {[}\textbf{\textcolor{red}{or remove it,
like James did}}{]}
\item Consider the four neighbors in the normal directions corresponding
to indicies
\begin{eqnarray*}
i^{*}-1,\, j^{*} &  & \text{cell above vessel}\\
i^{*}+1,\, j^{*} &  & \text{cell below vessel}\\
i^{*},\, j^{*}-1 &  & \text{cell to the left of vessel}\\
i^{*},\, j^{*}+1 &  & \text{cell to the right of vessel}
\end{eqnarray*}
and update them taking account of the boundary conditions, i.e. by
\ref{eq:eqn_13}. This corresponds to updating rows in $D$. Also
update $b_{c^{*}}=-q_{G}\Delta G_{S}/D_{G}$. Use \ref{eq:map_CfromIJ}
and \ref{eq:map_IJfromC} to switch between the representations.
\item Update all remaining cells according to \ref{eq:eqn_8}, switching
between representations by \ref{eq:map_CfromIJ} and \ref{eq:map_IJfromC}.
\item Find $D^{-1}\in\mathbb{R}^{N^{2}\times N^{2}}$ by eqn. \ref{eq:inversion_problem}
and reshape $D^{-1}$ into $G\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times N}$, \ref{eq:map_CfromIJ}
and \ref{eq:map_IJfromC} to convert.\end{enumerate}
